## 🔧 Configuration

### Customizing AI Behavior

The AI engine can be configured in `src/config/aiSettings.js`:

```javascript
export const AI_CONFIG = {
  naturalLanguageProcessing: {
    confidenceThreshold: 0.8,
    enableSmartSuggestions: true
  },
  scheduling: {
    defaultMeetingDuration: 60,
    focusTimeBlocks: 120,
    bufferTime: 15
  },
  analytics: {
    trackingEnabled: true,
    insightsFrequency: 'daily'
  }
};
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Theme Configuration

Modify colors and styling in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        ai: {
          primary: '#4F46E5',
          secondary: '#7C3AED',
          accent: '#06B6D4'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Adding Custom Event Types

Extend the event system in `src/types/eventTypes.js`:

```javascript
export const EVENT_TYPES = {
  meeting: { icon: Users, color: 'blue' },
  focus: { icon: Brain, color: 'green' },
  // Add your custom types here
  workout: { icon: Activity, color: 'red' },
  learning: { icon: BookOpen, color: 'indigo' }
};
```
